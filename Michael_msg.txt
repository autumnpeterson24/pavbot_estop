Michael E-Stop ROS Node :D

Stnadradized Architecture:
- ROS 2 Humble, (rclpp for C++ nodes)
- Serial Connection for Arduino Nano
- own a ROS 2 package repo and one node
- own a message contract (topics/services/actions) 

E-Stop topics:
- Jetson gets status of E-stop (are we triggered or nah??)
- custom message topic to publish: [ /safety/estop/state ]
- need a reset state? could do: [ /safety/estop/reset_request ]
- heartbeat: [ /safety/estop/heartbeat ]
*** /safety/estop is where you will be working with topics and you can add anything extra you might need!

ROS messages you can use:
* std_msgs/Bool (this is like a "built-in data type" for ROS that you can use)
- True = active estop | False = inactive estop
*** You could also use std_msgs/UInt8 if you want extra states (like heartbeat i.e. 0=OK, 1=ACTIVE, 2=UKNOWN, etc...)!! 
 - Here is a link to all std_msgs (https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/std_msgs/index-msg.html)
 - More Resources for rclpp: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/p/rclcpp/generated/index.html#rclcpp-ros-client-library-for-c


RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. open serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0) wherever the arduino is that connects estop

2. Parse data from arduino (send serial data for the ROS Node to know when estop is activated)
- I think you can directly send serial data directly with the Arduino for the Jetson to take in with the ROS node (i.e. Serial.write()???) https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/communication/serial/write/
	 
3. publish estop state topic: [ /safety/estop/state ], with message: [ std_msgs/Bool ]
4. publish last seen heartbeat topic: [ /safety/estop/heartbeat ], with message type: [ std_messages/UInt8 ]

5. Send status checks every x amount of Hz (like 20-50 maybe??) but send a state change IMMEDIATELY
6. Anything else you think Jetson might need from arduino!

*** NEVER FORGET
- if ever running anything inthe terminal to check your ros topics make sure you source your terminal with these commands:
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash

*** For Serial the POSIX library in ubuntu has all the serial communication needed maybe?
